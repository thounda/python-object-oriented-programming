# Python Object-Oriented Programming

The **object-oriented programming (OOP)** features in **Python** make it easier to build programs of increasing complexity and modularity.

Learn how to apply core _OOP_ principles to build programs that are extensible and efficient - starting with the basics of defining and using classes and objects. Then move into more advanced features like abstract base classes and how to implement interfaces.

Then, details on some of the more unique features of Python, like magic class methods to make your classes integrate tightly with the Python language and data classes to dramatically reduce the amount of boilerplate code needed to build data-centric objects.
